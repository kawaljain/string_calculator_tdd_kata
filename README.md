# string_calculator_tdd_kata

This is a simple implementation of a String Calculator in Node.js, developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Requirement:

-   **Empty string**: Returns `0` for an empty input.
-   **Single number**: Returns the number itself if only one number is provided.
-   **Comma-separated numbers**: Returns the sum of numbers separated by commas.
-   **Newline-separated numbers**: Supports splitting numbers using newlines (`\n`).
-   **Custom delimiters**: Allows users to specify custom delimiters by providing a delimiter before the number list.
-   **Negative Number**: Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed.”.

## TDD Approach

1. **Red**: Write a test that fails.
2. **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Refactor the code while ensuring that all tests still pass.
